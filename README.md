# My First Project — Mini Portfolio

A compact single-file portfolio demo built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (`index.html`).  
This repository is a simple starter you can show on your GitHub profile or use as a learning example for Git basics.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — single-file responsive portfolio demo (theme toggle, todos, like counter).
- `simple-intersest.sh` — small Bash script that calculates simple interest (example utility).
- `README.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` — repo docs.

## How to view
Open `index.html` in any browser (double-click or `open index.html`).

## Run the simple interest script
Make the script executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x simple-intersest.sh
./simple-intersest.sh       # interactive mode
# or pass args: ./simple-intersest.sh 1000 5 2
# (principal rate(in %) time(years))
